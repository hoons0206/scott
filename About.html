My name is F. Scott Fitzgerald.<br>
I write stories about longing, beauty, wealth, and the illusions that define American life. 
<br>I’ve spent my career trying to capture the spirit of a generation—the jazz-filled, champagne-soaked fever dream that both thrilled and destroyed us.
<br>
I published my first novel, This Side of Paradise, when I was twenty-four.<br>
It made me famous overnight, but fame, as I’ve learned, is a fickle friend. <br>
Since then, I’ve continued to write novels and short stories that explore the inner lives of dreamers, lovers, and the disillusioned.
<br>
You may have heard of The Great Gatsby. <br>
It’s the story of a man who believes in green lights and second chances—perhaps like all of us do, in one way or another. <br>
I never intended it to be a tragedy, though I now realize it couldn’t have ended any other way.
<br>
I split my time between writing novels, penning short stories for magazines, and occasionally working in Hollywood as a screenwriter. <br>
My words have taken me from Princeton to Paris, New York to the Riviera, and through both the glitter and the grief of the Jazz Age.
<br>
I’m still chasing the perfect sentence. 
<br>Until then, I invite you to browse through my work, and perhaps find something that lingers with you.
